    <h2> Welcome Home</h2>
      <p>A website where everyone has a little house, and inside this little house you can store all the information you want. A virtual library, cooking videos, studying tips, DIY projects etc. You can use your own designs for the house/furniture. Your friends can visit your house and see these various collections and can also leave little letters in your mailbox.</p>

    <h2>Interconnected</h2>
    <p>With all of this talk about complexcity and comapring a computer to an actual city, my idea is to create a website that when you search for one thing, it also shows you all these things connected to that one thing that you might have never known were interconnected.

      <h2>Lets Talk</h2>
      <p>A website where you can have conversations with complete strangers on different topics. Like a pen pal but online. Everyoneâ€™s identity remains anonymous and the only thing others can see is a little black circle which acts as profile picture. </p>
